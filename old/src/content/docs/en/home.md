Welcome to the Rust for JavaScript Developers documentation! This guide is designed to help JavaScript developers learn Rust by building on concepts they already know.

## Course Structure

1. **Introduction**: Get familiar with Rust and set up your development environment
2. **Language Fundamentals**: Learn about variables, data types, control flow, and functions
3. **Ownership & Borrowing**: Understand Rust's unique memory management system
4. **Structs & Enums**: Learn about Rust's data structures and how they compare to JavaScript objects
5. **Error Handling**: Master Rust's approach to error handling with Result and Option types
6. **Practical Projects**: Build real-world applications with Rust

## How to Use This Guide

We recommend going through the sections in order, as each builds on concepts from previous sections. However, if you're already familiar with some aspects of Rust, feel free to jump to specific topics.

Each section includes:
- **Conceptual explanations**: Understanding the "why" behind Rust features
- **JavaScript comparisons**: How Rust concepts map to JavaScript
- **Code examples**: Practical examples to demonstrate concepts
- **Exercises**: Hands-on practice to reinforce learning
