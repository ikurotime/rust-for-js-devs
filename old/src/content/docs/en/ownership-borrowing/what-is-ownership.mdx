#### Introduction to Ownership

Ownership is Rust's most unique feature and has deep implications for how the language works. It's what enables Rust to make memory safety guarantees without needing a garbage collector.

#### The Stack and the Heap

In Rust, data can be stored in two places:

##### The Stack

- Fixed size
- Fast access
- Last-in, first-out
- All data must have a known, fixed size

##### The Heap

- Dynamic size
- Slower access
- Memory is allocated at runtime
- Returns a pointer to that location

#### Ownership Rules

1. Each value has a variable that's its "owner"
2. There can only be one owner at a time
3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped

#### Variable Scope

```rust
{                      // s is not valid here
    let s = String::from("hello");   // s is valid from this point forward
    // do stuff with s
}                      // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid
```

#### Memory and Allocation

##### String Type

```rust
let s = String::from("hello");
```

##### Move

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1;  // s1's value moves to s2
// println!("{}", s1);  // This would cause an error
```

##### Clone

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1.clone();  // Deep copy
println!("{}", s1);  // This is fine
```

#### Ownership and Functions

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    takes_ownership(s);  // s's value moves into the function
    // println!("{}", s);  // This would cause an error
}

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) {
    println!("{}", some_string);
}  // some_string goes out of scope and is dropped
```

#### Return Values and Scope

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = gives_ownership();
    let s2 = String::from("hello");
    let s3 = takes_and_gives_back(s2);
}

fn gives_ownership() -> String {
    let some_string = String::from("hello");
    some_string
}

fn takes_and_gives_back(a_string: String) -> String {
    a_string
}
```

#### Comparing to JavaScript

JavaScript uses garbage collection:

```javascript
let s1 = "hello";
let s2 = s1;  // s1 is still valid
console.log(s1);  // "hello"
```

#### Conclusion

Ownership is a fundamental concept in Rust that enables memory safety without garbage collection.
