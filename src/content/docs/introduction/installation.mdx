# Installing Rust

JavaScript developers are familiar with Node.js and npm for building JavaScript applications. Similarly, Rust has its own toolchain that we'll install in this guide.

## Rustup: The Rust Toolchain Installer

The recommended way to install Rust is through `rustup`, which is similar in concept to `nvm` for Node.js. It allows you to:

- Install and manage multiple Rust versions
- Keep your Rust installation up to date
- Install additional components like documentation

## Installation Steps

### For macOS, Linux, and other Unix-like systems:

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

This is similar to how you might install developer tools on Unix systems (like `brew` or `nvm`).

Follow the on-screen instructions. Typically, you'll want the default installation option.

### For Windows:

1. Download the installer from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions

### Verifying Your Installation

After installation, you'll need to either restart your terminal or run:

```bash
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

Then verify your installation:

```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

You should see version information for both commands.

## Understanding the Rust Toolchain

When you install Rust through `rustup`, you get several important tools:

1. **rustc**: The Rust compiler (similar to Node.js's V8 engine)
2. **cargo**: Rust's package manager and build system (similar to npm/yarn)
3. **rustup**: The toolchain installer and manager itself

## JavaScript Equivalents

| JavaScript Ecosystem | Rust Ecosystem |
|----------------------|----------------|
| `node` | `rustc` |
| `npm` / `yarn` | `cargo` |
| `nvm` | `rustup` |
| `package.json` | `Cargo.toml` |
| `node_modules/` | `target/` |
| `npx` | `cargo run` |

## Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

Most JavaScript developers are used to excellent editor support. For Rust, the best experience is currently with:

### Visual Studio Code

If you're already using VS Code for JavaScript, you can add Rust support:

1. Install the [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer) extension
2. Optionally install [CodeLLDB](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vadimcn.vscode-lldb) for debugging

### Other Editors

- **JetBrains IDEs**: Use the Rust plugin or the dedicated [RustRover](https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/)
- **Vim/Neovim**: Use rust-analyzer with CoC or built-in LSP
- **Emacs**: Use rust-analyzer with Eglot or LSP-mode

## Setting Up Your First Project

Now that you have Rust installed, you can [create your first Rust project](/introduction/hello-cargo/) using Cargo!

## Updating Rust

To update your Rust installation (similar to `npm update -g`):

```bash
rustup update
```

## Troubleshooting

### Missing Compiler Tools on Windows

If you're on Windows and encounter errors about missing tools, you might need to install the [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/).

### Path Issues

If you get "command not found" errors, ensure that `~/.cargo/bin` is in your PATH.

### Getting Help

If you encounter any issues, the Rust community is very helpful:

- [Rust User Forums](https://users.rust-lang.org/)
- [Rust Discord](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust)
