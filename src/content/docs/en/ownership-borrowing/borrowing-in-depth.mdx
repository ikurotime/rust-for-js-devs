title: Borrowing in Depth
description: A deeper dive into Rust's borrowing system for JavaScript developers
---

In the previous section, we introduced Rust's ownership system and the concept of borrowing. Now, let's dive deeper into borrowing and explore its nuances.

## Quick Recap: What is Borrowing?

Borrowing in Rust is the ability to reference a value without taking ownership of it. It's similar to how in JavaScript you can pass an object to a function which can read or modify it without affecting whether the caller still has access to that object.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    
    // Immutable borrow - s is passed by reference
    let len = calculate_length(&s);
    
    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

## Types of References

Rust has two types of references:

1. **Immutable references** (`&T`) - Allow reading but not modifying
2. **Mutable references** (`&mut T`) - Allow both reading and modifying

Let's explore each in detail.

### Immutable References

Immutable references allow you to read data but not modify it:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    
    let r1 = &s; // First immutable reference
    let r2 = &s; // Second immutable reference
    
    println!("{} and {}", r1, r2);
}
```

You can have multiple immutable references to the same data at the same time. This is similar to multiple variables in JavaScript referencing the same object.

### Mutable References

Mutable references allow you to modify the borrowed data:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");
    
    let r1 = &mut s; // Mutable reference
    r1.push_str(", world");
    
    println!("{}", r1);
}
```

## The Borrowing Rules

Rust enforces the following rules for borrowing:

1. At any given time, you can have **either**:
   - One mutable reference, OR
   - Any number of immutable references

2. References must always be valid (no dangling references)

These rules prevent **data races** at compile time. A data race occurs when:
- Two or more pointers access the same data simultaneously
- At least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data
- There's no mechanism to synchronize the access

### Example: Preventing Data Races

This code will not compile because it violates rule #1:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");
    
    let r1 = &s;      // Immutable borrow
    let r2 = &s;      // Another immutable borrow - this is fine
    let r3 = &mut s;  // ❌ Error: cannot borrow `s` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
    
    println!("{}, {}, and {}", r1, r2, r3);
}
```

### Non-Lexical Lifetimes (NLL)

Rust's borrow checker is smart enough to understand when a reference is no longer needed:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");
    
    let r1 = &s;
    let r2 = &s;
    println!("{} and {}", r1, r2);
    // r1 and r2 are no longer used after this point
    
    let r3 = &mut s;  // ✅ This is fine now
    println!("{}", r3);
}
```

This is called Non-Lexical Lifetimes (NLL) - the compiler understands that the immutable borrows are no longer used after the first `println!`, so it allows the mutable borrow.

## Borrowing and Functions

When you pass a reference to a function, the function borrows the value:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");
    
    add_world(&mut s);  // Pass mutable reference
    println!("{}", s);  // Prints "hello, world"
}

fn add_world(s: &mut String) {
    s.push_str(", world");
}
```

The function `add_world` borrows `s` mutably, modifies it, and then the borrow ends when the function returns.

## Comparing to JavaScript

In JavaScript, all objects are passed by reference implicitly:

```javascript
function addWorld(s) {
  s.value += ", world";
}

const myString = { value: "hello" };
addWorld(myString);
console.log(myString.value); // "hello, world"
```

But there's a crucial difference: JavaScript doesn't prevent data races at compile time. This code will run without errors but could cause bugs:

```javascript
// JavaScript doesn't prevent this potential race condition
const data = { value: 10 };

// These could run concurrently in a web app
function increment() {
  data.value += 1;
}

function double() {
  data.value *= 2;
}
```

## The Ref Pattern in JavaScript

Some JavaScript libraries use a pattern that's conceptually similar to Rust's references:

```javascript
// React's useRef hook creates a mutable reference
function Counter() {
  const countRef = useRef(0);
  
  function handleClick() {
    countRef.current += 1;
    console.log(`You clicked ${countRef.current} times`);
  }
  
  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>;
}
```

## Borrowing and Iterators

When working with collections, borrowing becomes especially important:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    
    // Immutable borrow for iteration
    for i in &v {
        println!("{}", i);
    }
    
    // Mutable borrow for modifying during iteration
    for i in &mut v {
        *i += 50; // Dereference to modify the value
    }
    
    println!("{:?}", v); // [51, 52, 53, 54, 55]
}
```

## The Borrow Checker

Rust's borrow checker is the compiler component that enforces these rules. It analyzes the scope of all borrows and ensures they don't violate any rules.

If the borrow checker can prove that your code follows all the borrowing rules, it compiles successfully. Otherwise, it rejects your code with an error message.

## Interior Mutability

Sometimes you need to modify a value even when you only have an immutable reference. Rust provides **interior mutability** patterns for these cases:

```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;

fn main() {
    let data = RefCell::new(5);
    
    // We can modify the value through an immutable reference
    let borrowed = &data;
    *borrowed.borrow_mut() += 1;
    
    println!("Value: {}", *borrowed.borrow()); // Value: 6
}
```

Interior mutability is a relatively advanced topic, but it's similar to how in JavaScript you can have a `const` object but still modify its properties:

```javascript
const user = {
  name: "Alice",
  score: 0
};

// The binding is const, but we can modify properties
user.score += 10;
```

## Common Borrowing Patterns

### Splitting Borrows

You can borrow different parts of a data structure simultaneously:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello world");
    
    // Split the string into two parts
    let hello = &s[0..5];  // Immutable borrow of first 5 chars
    let world = &mut s[6..11];  // Mutable borrow of remaining chars
    
    // This is allowed because the borrows don't overlap
    world.make_ascii_uppercase();
    
    println!("{} {}", hello, world); // "hello WORLD"
}
```

### Self-Referential Structs

Creating structures that contain references to themselves is challenging in Rust. This is where you might need more advanced patterns like `Rc` and `RefCell` or create a different data structure.

## Conclusion

Borrowing is a core concept in Rust that enables:

1. Memory safety without a garbage collector
2. Concurrency without data races
3. Efficient passing of data without unnecessary copying

While borrowing rules might seem restrictive coming from JavaScript, they prevent entire classes of bugs that would only appear at runtime in JavaScript.
