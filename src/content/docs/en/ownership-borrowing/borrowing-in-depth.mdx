#### Quick Recap: What is Borrowing?

Borrowing is Rust's way of letting you have references to data without taking ownership of it. It's similar to how JavaScript handles object references, but with strict rules enforced at compile time.

#### Types of References

In Rust, there are two types of references:

##### Immutable References

```rust
let x = 5;
let y = &x;  // y is an immutable reference to x
println!("{}", *y);  // Dereference y to get the value
```

##### Mutable References

```rust
let mut x = 5;
let y = &mut x;  // y is a mutable reference to x
*y += 1;  // Modify x through y
```

#### The Borrowing Rules

Rust enforces three main rules for borrowing:

1. You can have either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references
2. References must always be valid
3. No data races allowed

##### Example: Preventing Data Races

```rust
let mut data = vec![1, 2, 3];

// This would cause a data race in JavaScript
let first = &data[0];
data.push(4);  // Error: cannot borrow `data` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
```

##### Non-Lexical Lifetimes (NLL)

Rust's borrow checker is smart enough to know when a reference is no longer used:

```rust
let mut x = 5;
let y = &x;  // First borrow
println!("{}", y);  // Last use of y
let z = &mut x;  // This is fine because y is no longer used
```

#### Borrowing and Functions

Functions can take references as parameters:

```rust
fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}

let s = String::from("hello");
let len = calculate_length(&s);
```

#### Comparing to JavaScript

JavaScript's approach to references is more relaxed:

```javascript
const obj = { value: 5 };
const ref1 = obj;  // Both variables reference the same object
const ref2 = obj;  // Can have multiple references

ref1.value = 10;  // Modifies the shared object
console.log(ref2.value);  // 10
```

#### The Ref Pattern in JavaScript

JavaScript developers often use the ref pattern in React:

```javascript
function Component() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);
  return <input ref={inputRef} />;
}
```

#### Borrowing and Iterators

Rust's iterators often use borrowing:

```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
for i in &v {  // Borrow v
    println!("{}", i);
}
```

#### The Borrow Checker

The borrow checker is Rust's compile-time mechanism that ensures memory safety.

#### Interior Mutability

Sometimes you need to mutate data through an immutable reference:

```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;

let data = RefCell::new(5);
*data.borrow_mut() += 1;  // Mutate through an immutable reference
```

#### Common Borrowing Patterns

##### Splitting Borrows

You can split a borrow into multiple parts:

```rust
let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3];
let (first, rest) = v.split_at_mut(1);
```

##### Self-Referential Structs

Sometimes you need a struct that contains a reference to itself.

#### Conclusion

Borrowing is a powerful feature that allows Rust to provide memory safety without garbage collection.
