Now that we've covered the basics, let's build a simple guessing game to get a better feel for Rust. We'll build the same application in both Rust and JavaScript to highlight the differences and similarities.

### Project Home

We'll create a number guessing game where:
1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100
2. The player inputs guesses
3. The program provides feedback on each guess
4. The game continues until the player guesses correctly

### Setting Up the Rust Project

Let's start by creating a new Rust project:

```bash
cargo new guessing_game
cd guessing_game
```

### The Initial Rust Program

Open `src/main.rs` and replace its contents with:

```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");
    
    println!("Please input your guess:");
    
    let mut guess = String::new();
    
    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut guess)
        .expect("Failed to read line");
        
    println!("You guessed: {}", guess);
}
```

### JavaScript Equivalent

For comparison, here's how we'd start in JavaScript:

```javascript
const readline = require('readline').createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout
});

console.log("Guess the number!");

console.log("Please input your guess:");

readline.question('', (guess) => {
  console.log(`You guessed: ${guess}`);
  readline.close();
});
```

### Understanding the Rust Code

Let's break down the Rust code:

1. `use std::io;` - Imports the I/O library (similar to `require` in Node.js)
2. `let mut guess = String::new();` - Creates a mutable variable (note `mut`)
3. `io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess)` - Gets user input and stores it in `guess`
4. `.expect("Failed to read line")` - Handles potential errors (we'll explore better error handling later)

Key differences from JavaScript:
- Variables are immutable by default in Rust; we need `mut` to make them mutable
- In Rust, we handle errors explicitly with `.expect()` or other error handling methods

### Adding Random Number Generation

Let's update our program to generate a random number. First, we need to add the `rand` crate to our dependencies.

Edit `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
rand = "0.8.5"
```

Now, update `src/main.rs`:

```rust
use std::io;
use std::cmp::Ordering;
use rand::Rng;

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");
    
    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);
    
    println!("The secret number is: {}", secret_number); // For debugging
    
    println!("Please input your guess:");
    
    let mut guess = String::new();
    
    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut guess)
        .expect("Failed to read line");
        
    let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect("Please type a number!");
        
    println!("You guessed: {}", guess);
    
    match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
        Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
        Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
        Ordering::Equal => println!("You win!"),
    }
}
```

### JavaScript Equivalent

```javascript
const readline = require('readline').createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout
});

console.log("Guess the number!");

const secretNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;

console.log(`The secret number is: ${secretNumber}`); // For debugging

console.log("Please input your guess:");

readline.question('', (guessInput) => {
  const guess = Number(guessInput.trim());
  
  console.log(`You guessed: ${guess}`);
  
  if (guess < secretNumber) {
    console.log("Too small!");
  } else if (guess > secretNumber) {
    console.log("Too big!");
  } else {
    console.log("You win!");
  }
  
  readline.close();
});
```

### Key Differences So Far

1. **Error Handling**: 
   - Rust: Explicit with `.expect()` or other methods
   - JavaScript: Often implicit or with try/catch blocks

2. **Type Conversion**:
   - Rust: Explicit parsing with `.parse()` to convert strings to numbers
   - JavaScript: Implicit conversion or explicit with `Number()`

3. **Comparison**:
   - Rust: Uses pattern matching with `match` expression
   - JavaScript: Uses if/else statements

### Adding a Loop for Multiple Guesses

Let's update our Rust program to allow multiple guesses:

```rust
use std::io;
use std::cmp::Ordering;
use rand::Rng;

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");
    
    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);
    
    loop {
        println!("Please input your guess:");
        
        let mut guess = String::new();
        
        io::stdin()
            .read_line(&mut guess)
            .expect("Failed to read line");
            
        let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
            Ok(num) => num,
            Err(_) => {
                println!("Please type a number!");
                continue;
            }
        };
            
        println!("You guessed: {}", guess);
        
        match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
            Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
            Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
            Ordering::Equal => {
                println!("You win!");
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## JavaScript Equivalent

```javascript
const readline = require('readline');

function guessTheNumber() {
  const rl = readline.createInterface({
    input: process.stdin,
    output: process.stdout
  });
  
  console.log("Guess the number!");
  
  const secretNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;
  
  const askGuess = () => {
    rl.question('Please input your guess: ', (guessInput) => {
      const guess = Number(guessInput.trim());
      
      if (isNaN(guess)) {
        console.log("Please type a number!");
        askGuess();
        return;
      }
      
      console.log(`You guessed: ${guess}`);
      
      if (guess < secretNumber) {
        console.log("Too small!");
        askGuess();
      } else if (guess > secretNumber) {
        console.log("Too big!");
        askGuess();
      } else {
        console.log("You win!");
        rl.close();
      }
    });
  };
  
  askGuess();
}

guessTheNumber();
```

### Improved Error Handling

Notice how our Rust code now uses pattern matching to handle potential errors when parsing the input:

```rust
let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
    Ok(num) => num,
    Err(_) => {
        println!("Please type a number!");
        continue;
    }
};
```

This is using Rust's `Result` type, which we'll explore more in the error handling section.

### Running the Complete Game

Run the Rust version:

```bash
cargo run
```

### Comparing the Full Implementations

Let's highlight the key differences between our Rust and JavaScript implementations:

1. **Memory Safety**: 
   - Rust guarantees memory safety at compile time
   - JavaScript relies on runtime checks and garbage collection

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Rust uses Result types that force us to handle errors explicitly
   - JavaScript typically uses try/catch blocks or callbacks for error handling

3. **Type System**:
   - Rust is statically typed, requiring explicit type annotations
   - JavaScript is dynamically typed with optional type systems like TypeScript

4. **Concurrency Model**:
   - Rust's ownership system prevents data races at compile time
   - JavaScript uses an event loop with a single thread by default

5. **Performance**:
   - Rust compiles to native code with performance similar to C/C++
   - JavaScript depends on the runtime's JIT compiler

### Next Steps

You've now successfully built a complete, interactive guessing game using Rust's language features. Next, we'll cover [Common Programming Concepts](/en/common-concepts/variables-mutability/) in more detail, starting with variables and mutability.
