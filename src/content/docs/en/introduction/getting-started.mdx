Just like you need Node.js for JavaScript development, you'll need the Rust toolchain to start developing with Rust. Let's get everything set up!

## Installing Rust

Rust is installed via a tool called `rustup`, which is both a version manager and installer for Rust.

### For macOS, Linux, and other Unix-like systems:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### For Windows:

Download and run [rustup-init.exe](https://win.rustup.rs/) and follow the on-screen instructions.

### Verifying Your Installation

After installation, you should be able to run:

```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

You should see version information for both tools.

## Understanding the Rust Toolchain

When you install Rust, you get several tools:

- **rustc**: The Rust compiler
- **cargo**: Rust's package manager and build system (think npm + webpack for Rust)
- **rustup**: The Rust toolchain manager (used for updating Rust)

## Your First Rust Program

Let's create a simple "Hello, World!" program to test our installation.

### JavaScript Version

First, let's see what this would look like in JavaScript:

```javascript
// hello.js
console.log("Hello, world!");
```

You would run this with:

```bash
node hello.js
```

### Rust Version

Now, let's write the same in Rust:

1. Create a new directory for your project:

```bash
mkdir hello_rust
cd hello_rust
```

2. Create a new Rust file named `main.rs`:

```rust
// main.rs
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

3. Compile and run:

```bash
rustc main.rs
./main
```

You should see "Hello, world!" printed to the console.

## Creating a Project with Cargo

While you can compile Rust files directly with `rustc`, most Rust development is done with Cargo, Rust's package manager and build tool.

### Creating a New Project

```bash
cargo new hello_cargo
cd hello_cargo
```

This creates a new directory with:
- `Cargo.toml`: Similar to package.json in npm, defines your project and dependencies
- `src/main.rs`: Your main source file

### Building and Running

```bash
cargo build  # Compiles your project
cargo run    # Compiles and runs your project
```

## Key Differences from JavaScript

Here are some immediate differences you'll notice:

1. **Compilation**: Rust is compiled ahead of time, while JavaScript is typically interpreted or JIT-compiled.
2. **Type System**: Rust has a static type system, unlike JavaScript's dynamic typing.
3. **Memory Management**: Rust manages memory through ownership, without garbage collection.
4. **Syntax**: Rust uses `fn` for functions instead of `function`, and has a mandatory `main()` function as the entry point.

## Next Steps

Now that you have Rust installed and have run your first program, let's dive deeper into [Rust's syntax and basic concepts](/en/language-fundamentals/).
