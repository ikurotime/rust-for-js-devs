Cargo is Rust's package manager and build system. It's similar to npm or yarn in the JavaScript ecosystem, but with additional features for building and testing your code.

### Why Use Cargo?

If you're coming from JavaScript, you're probably familiar with package managers like npm or yarn. Cargo serves a similar purpose, but it's even more central to the Rust ecosystem:

- **Dependency Management**: Like npm, Cargo downloads and manages your project's dependencies
- **Build System**: Cargo compiles your code, similar to webpack or other build tools
- **Task Runner**: Cargo can run tests, generate documentation, and publish packages

### Creating a New Project with Cargo

Instead of manually creating files like we did in the previous section, let's use Cargo to create a new project:

```bash
cargo new hello_cargo
cd hello_cargo
```

This is similar to `npm init` or `yarn init` in JavaScript, but it actually creates more initial files.

### Project Structure

Let's look at what Cargo created:

```
hello_cargo/
├── Cargo.toml
└── src/
    └── main.rs
```

This is similar to a JavaScript project structure:

| Rust | JavaScript | Purpose |
|------|------------|---------|
| `Cargo.toml` | `package.json` | Project configuration and dependencies |
| `src/` | `src/` | Source code directory |
| `target/` (created later) | `node_modules/` | Build artifacts and dependencies |

### Understanding Cargo.toml

Open `Cargo.toml` and you'll see something like:

```toml
[package]
name = "hello_cargo"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

[dependencies]
```

This is similar to a `package.json` file in JavaScript:

- `[package]` contains metadata about your project
- `[dependencies]` is where you'll list external libraries (called "crates" in Rust)

### Looking at the Source Code

Now, look at `src/main.rs`:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

Cargo created a "Hello, world!" program for us automatically.

### Building and Running with Cargo

Cargo provides commands for building and running your project:

#### Building the Project

```bash
cargo build
```

This creates an executable in `target/debug/hello_cargo` (or `target\debug\hello_cargo.exe` on Windows).

This is similar to using a build script in a JavaScript project, but more standardized.

#### Running the Project

You can run the built executable directly, or use:

```bash
cargo run
```

This will build (if necessary) and then run your program in one step. It's similar to `npm start` or `yarn start` in JavaScript projects.

#### Checking Your Code Without Building

If you want to check your code compiles without producing an executable:

```bash
cargo check
```

This is faster than `cargo build` and useful during development, similar to using a linter in JavaScript.

### Building for Release

When you're ready to release your program, use:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

This creates an optimized executable in `target/release/` instead of `target/debug/`.

This is similar to the difference between development and production builds in JavaScript bundlers like webpack.

### Cargo Commands vs. npm/yarn Commands

| Cargo Command | npm/yarn Equivalent | Purpose |
|---------------|---------------------|---------|
| `cargo new` | `npm init`/`yarn init` | Create a new project |
| `cargo build` | `npm run build` | Build the project |
| `cargo run` | `npm start` | Build and run the project |
| `cargo test` | `npm test` | Run tests |
| `cargo add` | `npm install`/`yarn add` | Add a dependency |
| `cargo doc` | N/A (JSDoc) | Generate documentation |
| `cargo publish` | `npm publish` | Publish to registry |

### Adding Dependencies

To add dependencies to your project, you can either:

1. Manually edit `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
ferris-says = "0.2"
```

2. Or use the `cargo add` command (similar to `npm install`/`yarn add`):
```bash
cargo add ferris-says
```

After adding a dependency, run `cargo build` to download and compile it.

### Updating Dependencies

To update your dependencies:

```bash
cargo update
```

This is similar to `npm update` or `yarn upgrade`.

### Using External Crates

Let's modify our program to use an external crate. Edit `src/main.rs`:

```rust
use ferris_says::say;
use std::io::{stdout, BufWriter};

fn main() {
    let stdout = stdout();
    let message = String::from("Hello fellow Rustaceans!");
    let width = message.chars().count();
    
    let mut writer = BufWriter::new(stdout.lock());
    say(message.as_str(), width, &mut writer).unwrap();
}
```

Now run the program:

```bash
cargo run
```

You should see a message from Ferris, the unofficial Rust mascot:

```
----------------------------
< Hello fellow Rustaceans! >
----------------------------
              \
               \
                 _~^~^~_
             \) /  o o  \ (/
               '_   -   _'
               / '-----' \
```

## Cargo Lock File

After building your project, you'll notice a new file called `Cargo.lock`. This is similar to `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` in JavaScript projects. It records the exact versions of dependencies that were used so your builds are reproducible.

## Summary

Cargo is a powerful tool that combines:
- Package management (like npm/yarn)
- Build system (like webpack)
- Test runner (like Jest)
- Documentation generator
- Publishing tool

In the JavaScript ecosystem, these functions are often split across multiple tools, but Cargo brings them all together in one cohesive package.

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the basics of Cargo, let's move on to [building a more substantial program](/en/guessing-game/) that will give you a better feel for Rust's syntax and features.
