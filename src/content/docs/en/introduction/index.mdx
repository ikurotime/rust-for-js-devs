Welcome to Rust for JS Devs! This course is designed to help JavaScript developers learn Rust by leveraging their existing knowledge.

## What is Rust?

Rust is a systems programming language that focuses on safety, speed, and concurrency. Unlike JavaScript, which is interpreted and runs in a managed environment with a garbage collector, Rust compiles to machine code and gives you direct control over memory allocation without sacrificing safety.

## Why Learn Rust as a JavaScript Developer?

As a JavaScript developer, you might wonder why you should learn Rust. Here are some compelling reasons:

- **Performance**: Rust offers near-C performance with a modern syntax
- **Memory Safety**: Rust's compiler ensures memory safety without a garbage collector
- **Concurrency**: Write thread-safe code without the common pitfalls
- **WebAssembly**: Rust is a first-class language for WebAssembly, allowing you to write high-performance code for the web
- **Expanding Your Skills**: Learning a systems language like Rust expands your understanding of how computers work
