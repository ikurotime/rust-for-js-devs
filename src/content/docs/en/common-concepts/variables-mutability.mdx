One of the most noticeable differences between Rust and JavaScript is how variables and mutability work. Let's explore these differences to help you transition between the two languages.

#### Variables in JavaScript

In JavaScript, you can declare variables with `var`, `let`, or `const`:

```javascript
// Variable declarations in JavaScript
var oldSchool = "I'm hoisted";
let mutable = "I can be changed";
const immutable = "I cannot be reassigned";

// Reassignment
mutable = "New value";  // ✅ Works
// immutable = "New value";  // ❌ TypeError: Assignment to constant variable

// But objects declared with const CAN be modified
const person = { name: "Alice" };
person.name = "Bob";  // ✅ Works! Only the binding is immutable
```

#### Variables in Rust

Rust takes a different approach, making variables **immutable by default**:

```rust
// Variable declarations in Rust
let immutable = "I cannot be changed"; // Immutable by default
let mut mutable = "I can be changed";  // Use 'mut' to make mutable

// Reassignment
// immutable = "New value";  // ❌ Error: cannot assign twice to immutable variable
mutable = "New value";      // ✅ Works
```

#### Key Differences

- In JavaScript, variables declared with `let` are mutable by default
- In Rust, variables are immutable by default and require `mut` for mutability
- JavaScript's `const` prevents reassignment but not modification of object properties
- In Rust, immutability is more comprehensive (we'll see more when we get to references)

#### Constants

Both languages have constants, but they work differently:

##### JavaScript Constants

```javascript
const PI = 3.14159;
// PI = 3.0;  // ❌ Error: Assignment to constant variable

// But objects can be modified
const user = { name: "Alice" };
user.name = "Bob";  // ✅ Works - only the binding is constant, not the content
```

##### Rust Constants

```rust
const PI: f64 = 3.14159;
// PI = 3.0;  // ❌ Error: cannot assign to this expression

// Constants require type annotations and use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE by convention
const MAX_POINTS: u32 = 100_000;
```

Rust constants:
- Must have explicit type annotations
- Can only be set to a constant expression (evaluated at compile time)
- Can be declared in any scope, including the global scope
- Are inlined at compile time

#### Shadowing in Rust

Rust allows "shadowing" of variables, which is declaring a new variable with the same name as a previous variable:

```rust
let x = 5;
let x = x + 1;  // Shadows the previous 'x'
let x = x * 2;  // Shadows again

println!("The value of x is: {}", x);  // 12
```

This is different from mutation:

```rust
// With shadowing
let spaces = "   ";
let spaces = spaces.len();  // ✅ Works, type can change with shadowing

// With mutation
let mut spaces = "   ";
// spaces = spaces.len();  // ❌ Error: mismatched types
```

##### JavaScript Variable Shadowing

JavaScript has similar behavior with block-scoped variables:

```javascript
let x = 5;
{
  let x = x + 1;  // Shadows the outer 'x'
  console.log(x);  // 6
}
console.log(x);  // 5
```

However, you can't redeclare the same variable in the same scope in JavaScript:

```javascript
let x = 10;
let x = 20;  // ❌ SyntaxError: Identifier 'x' has already been declared
```

#### Variable Scope

Both languages use curly braces to define scopes:

##### JavaScript

```javascript
{
  let x = 10;
  console.log(x);  // 10
}
// console.log(x);  // ❌ ReferenceError: x is not defined
```

##### Rust

```rust
{
    let x = 10;
    println!("x: {}", x);  // 10
}
// println!("x: {}", x);  // ❌ Error: cannot find value `x` in this scope
```

#### Naming Conventions

##### JavaScript

- `camelCase` for variables and functions
- `PascalCase` for classes and constructor functions
- `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants

##### Rust

- `snake_case` for variables and functions
- `PascalCase` for types and traits
- `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants and static variables

#### Type Inference

Both Rust and JavaScript can infer types, but in very different ways:

##### JavaScript (Dynamic Typing)

```javascript
let x = 5;        // Number
x = "hello";      // Now it's a String - no problem!
```

##### Rust (Static Typing with Inference)

```rust
let x = 5;        // Inferred as i32
// x = "hello";   // ❌ Error: mismatched types

// Need explicit type annotation for type changes
let x = 5;        // i32
let x: &str = "hello"; // Shadowing with a new type
```

#### Destructuring

Both languages support destructuring:

##### JavaScript

```javascript
const point = { x: 10, y: 20 };
const { x, y } = point;
console.log(x, y);  // 10 20

const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const [first, second] = numbers;
console.log(first, second);  // 1 2
```

##### Rust

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

let point = Point { x: 10, y: 20 };
let Point { x, y } = point;
println!("x: {}, y: {}", x, y);  // x: 10, y: 20

let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
let [first, second, _] = numbers;
println!("first: {}, second: {}", first, second);  // first: 1, second: 2
```

### Best Practices

#### JavaScript

- Use `const` by default, `let` when you need to reassign
- Avoid `var` in modern JavaScript
- Use meaningful variable names
- Keep variables close to where they're used

#### Rust

- Use immutable variables by default
- Only use `mut` when you need to change a value
- Use shadowing for type changes or when you want to reuse a name
- Follow Rust naming conventions
- Keep variables in the smallest scope possible

## Memory Considerations

An important difference that isn't immediately visible is how these variables are stored in memory:

### JavaScript

JavaScript handles memory allocation and garbage collection automatically. You generally don't need to worry about where values live.

### Rust

In Rust, values can be allocated on the stack or heap, and the ownership system (which we'll cover later) determines how memory is managed.

```rust
// Stack allocated
let x = 5;  

// Heap allocated, but Rust abstracts memory management
let s = String::from("hello");
```
