Good code is well-documented, and comments are an essential part of that documentation. In this section, we'll explore how comments work in Rust and compare them to JavaScript.

### Regular Comments

#### Single-Line Comments

Both Rust and JavaScript use `//` for single-line comments:

```rust
// This is a single-line comment in Rust
let x = 5; // This is an end-of-line comment
```

```javascript
// This is a single-line comment in JavaScript
let x = 5; // This is an end-of-line comment
```

#### Multi-Line Comments

Both languages also support multi-line comments, though with slightly different syntax:

**Rust:**
```rust
/* This is a multi-line comment in Rust.
   It can span multiple lines.
   Rust allows nested /* multi-line */ comments. */
```

**JavaScript:**
```javascript
/* This is a multi-line comment in JavaScript.
   It can span multiple lines.
   JavaScript doesn't allow nested /* multi-line */ comments. */
```

The key difference is that Rust allows nesting multi-line comments, while JavaScript doesn't.

### Documentation Comments

This is where Rust really shines compared to JavaScript. Rust has built-in documentation comments that can be processed by `rustdoc` to generate HTML documentation.

#### Rust Documentation Comments

Rust has two types of documentation comments:

1. `///` - Used to document the item that follows
2. `//!` - Used to document the containing item (like a module)

**Example of `///` documentation comments:**

```rust
/// Calculates the sum of two numbers.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// let result = add(2, 3);
/// assert_eq!(result, 5);
/// ```
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}
```

**Example of `//!` documentation comments:**

```rust
//! # My Math Library
//!
//! A collection of mathematical functions.

/// Calculates the sum of two numbers.
pub fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}
```

#### JavaScript Documentation Comments

JavaScript doesn't have built-in documentation comments, but it does have JSDoc, a documentation standard:

```javascript
/**
 * Calculates the sum of two numbers.
 * 
 * @param {number} a - The first number
 * @param {number} b - The second number
 * @returns {number} The sum of a and b
 * 
 * @example
 * // returns 5
 * add(2, 3);
 */
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

### Markdown Support

Rust's documentation comments support Markdown, which allows for rich formatting:

```rust
/// # Add Function
///
/// Calculates the sum of two numbers.
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// ```
/// let result = add(2, 3);
/// assert_eq!(result, 5);
/// ```
///
/// ## Panics
///
/// This function does not panic.
///
/// ## Safety
///
/// This function is safe to use.
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}
```

JSDoc also supports HTML formatting and some Markdown-like syntax:

```javascript
/**
 * # Add Function
 * 
 * Calculates the sum of two numbers.
 * 
 * ## Examples
 * 
 * ```js
 * // returns 5
 * add(2, 3);
 * ```
 * 
 * @param {number} a - The first number
 * @param {number} b - The second number
 * @returns {number} The sum of a and b
 */
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

### Generating Documentation

#### Rust Documentation Generation

Rust's documentation can be generated and viewed locally using Cargo:

```bash
# Generate documentation for your project and its dependencies
cargo doc --open
```

This generates HTML documentation and opens it in your browser.

#### JavaScript Documentation Generation

JavaScript requires external tools like JSDoc, TypeDoc, or ESDoc:

```bash
# Example with JSDoc
npm install --save-dev jsdoc
npx jsdoc yourfile.js -d docs
```

### Doc Tests

One of the coolest features of Rust's documentation system is that code examples in documentation are actually run as tests:

```rust
/// Returns the square of a number.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// let result = square(4);
/// assert_eq!(result, 16);
/// ```
fn square(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x * x
}
```

When you run `cargo test`, the example in the comment is compiled and run as a test. This ensures that your documentation examples stay up-to-date with your code.

JavaScript doesn't have this feature built-in, though some tools can extract and run examples from JSDoc comments.

### Common Documentation Conventions

#### Rust Documentation Sections

Rust has some conventional section headers used in documentation comments:

- `# Examples` - Code examples
- `# Panics` - Situations where the function might panic
- `# Errors` - Error types that might be returned
- `# Safety` - Safety considerations for unsafe functions
- `# Implementation Details` - Notes about the implementation

#### JavaScript Documentation Tags

JSDoc uses tags for similar purposes:

- `@example` - Code examples
- `@throws` - Exceptions that might be thrown
- `@param` - Parameter descriptions
- `@returns` - Return value description
- `@see` - Related functions or resources

### Comments as a Last Resort

Both Rust and JavaScript communities encourage writing self-documenting code:

> "Good code is its own best documentation." â€” Steve McConnell

Comments should explain "why" something is done a certain way, not "what" is being done (the code should make that clear).

### Comment Best Practices

1. **Write self-documenting code first** - Use descriptive variable and function names
2. **Explain why, not what** - The code shows what it's doing; comments should explain why
3. **Keep comments updated** - Outdated comments are worse than no comments
4. **Use documentation comments for public APIs** - Help users understand how to use your code
5. **Comment complex algorithms** - Even if the code is clear, the underlying algorithm might not be
