# Defining Structs in Rust

Structs in Rust are similar to objects and classes in JavaScript, but with important differences in how they're defined and used. They're a fundamental way to create custom data types for your program.

## What are Structs?

A struct (short for "structure") is a custom data type that lets you package together and name multiple related values that make up a meaningful group. If you're coming from JavaScript, you can think of structs as being similar to objects or as the data portion of classes.

## JavaScript vs Rust: Data Structures

Let's compare how we define structured data in both languages:

```javascript
// JavaScript object literal
const user = {
  username: "rustacean",
  email: "rust@example.com",
  active: true,
  signupDate: new Date()
};

// JavaScript class
class User {
  constructor(username, email) {
    this.username = username;
    this.email = email;
    this.active = true;
    this.signupDate = new Date();
  }
}
```

In Rust, we use structs:

```rust
// Rust struct definition
struct User {
    username: String,
    email: String,
    active: bool,
    sign_up_date: chrono::DateTime<chrono::Utc>,
}
```

The key differences are:
- Rust requires explicit type annotations for all fields
- Rust uses the `struct` keyword to define a new structure
- Fields are separated by commas in JavaScript, by semicolons in Rust
- You can't just create a struct on the fly like a JavaScript object literal

## Creating Instances of Structs

Let's see how we create instances in both languages:

```javascript
// JavaScript object creation
const user1 = {
  username: "rustacean",
  email: "rust@example.com",
  active: true,
  signupDate: new Date()
};

// JavaScript class instantiation
const user2 = new User("rustacean", "rust@example.com");
```

In Rust:

```rust
// Creating an instance of a struct
let user = User {
    username: String::from("rustacean"),
    email: String::from("rust@example.com"),
    active: true,
    sign_up_date: chrono::Utc::now(),
};
```

Notice that in Rust:
- You specify the struct name followed by curly braces
- You must provide values for all fields (unless you use struct update syntax)
- Each field is assigned with a colon, and fields are separated by commas
- The entire struct instantiation is an expression (ends with a semicolon)

## Field Init Shorthand

Both JavaScript and Rust provide a shorthand when variable names match field names:

```javascript
// JavaScript shorthand property names
function createUser(username, email) {
  return {
    username,  // Same as username: username
    email,     // Same as email: email
    active: true,
    signupDate: new Date()
  };
}
```

Rust has a similar feature:

```rust
fn build_user(username: String, email: String) -> User {
    User {
        username,  // Same as username: username
        email,     // Same as email: email
        active: true,
        sign_up_date: chrono::Utc::now(),
    }
}
```

## Struct Update Syntax

JavaScript's spread operator allows copying properties from one object to another:

```javascript
const user1 = {
  username: "rustacean",
  email: "rust@example.com",
  active: true,
  signupDate: new Date()
};

// Create user2 based on user1, overriding the email
const user2 = {
  ...user1,
  email: "new@example.com"
};
```

Rust has similar functionality with struct update syntax:

```rust
let user2 = User {
    email: String::from("new@example.com"),
    ..user1  // Use the rest of values from user1
};
```

An important distinction: Rust's update syntax moves data that doesn't implement the `Copy` trait, which means you might not be able to use `user1` after creating `user2` if `user1` contains types like `String` that don't implement `Copy`.

## Tuple Structs

Rust has a special kind of struct called a tuple struct, which is a combination of a tuple and a struct:

```rust
struct Color(i32, i32, i32);  // RGB color
struct Point(i32, i32, i32);  // 3D point

let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);
```

Tuple structs are useful when you want to give a tuple a name and make it a different type from other tuples, but don't want to name each field.

## Unit-Like Structs

Rust allows structs without any fields, called unit-like structs:

```rust
struct AlwaysEqual;

let subject = AlwaysEqual;
```

These are useful when you need to implement a trait on some type but don't have any data to store in the type itself.

## Ownership of Struct Data

A key difference from JavaScript is that Rust enforces ownership rules with structs:

```rust
struct User {
    username: String,  // This struct owns these Strings
    email: String,
}
```

The struct above owns all of its data. When the struct goes out of scope, all its data is freed, including the heap-allocated strings.

If you want a struct to store references to data owned elsewhere, you'll need to use lifetimes (which we'll cover later):

```rust
struct UserRef<'a> {
    username: &'a str,  // This struct borrows these strings
    email: &'a str,
}
```

## JavaScript Classes vs Rust Structs + Impl

In JavaScript, classes combine data and methods:

```javascript
class Rectangle {
  constructor(width, height) {
    this.width = width;
    this.height = height;
  }
  
  area() {
    return this.width * this.height;
  }
}

const rect = new Rectangle(10, 5);
console.log(rect.area());  // 50
```

In Rust, data (structs) and behavior (methods) are separated, with methods defined in `impl` blocks:

```rust
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }
}

let rect = Rectangle { width: 10, height: 5 };
println!("Area: {}", rect.area());  // Area: 50
```

We'll dive deeper into methods in the upcoming "Method Syntax" section.

## Field Visibility

JavaScript uses the `#` symbol for private fields in classes:

```javascript
class User {
  #passwordHash;  // Private field
  
  constructor(username, password) {
    this.username = username;  // Public field
    this.#passwordHash = hashPassword(password);
  }
}
```

Rust uses its module system to control visibility with the `pub` keyword:

```rust
pub struct User {
    pub username: String,  // Public field
    email: String,         // Private field (within the module)
    password_hash: String, // Private field
}
```

By default, struct fields are private to the module they're defined in.

## Comparing Structs

JavaScript objects can be compared with `===` but this only checks if they are the same object reference:

```javascript
const obj1 = { x: 1, y: 2 };
const obj2 = { x: 1, y: 2 };
console.log(obj1 === obj2);  // false (different objects)
```

Rust doesn't have built-in equality for structs. You need to implement or derive traits like `PartialEq` to enable comparison:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq)]
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

let p1 = Point { x: 1, y: 2 };
let p2 = Point { x: 1, y: 2 };
println!("{}", p1 == p2);  // true (same values)
```

## Printing Structs

In JavaScript, objects are automatically converted to strings when needed:

```javascript
const rect = { width: 10, height: 5 };
console.log(rect);  // { width: 10, height: 5 }
```

In Rust, you need to implement or derive the `Debug` or `Display` traits:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

let rect = Rectangle { width: 10, height: 5 };
println!("{:?}", rect);     // Rectangle { width: 10, height: 5 }
println!("{:#?}", rect);    // Pretty print
```

## When to Use Structs

Use structs when:
- You need to group related data together
- You want to name each piece of data
- You need a custom data type with specific behavior
- You want to build up abstractions in your code

In the next section, we'll explore structs in more depth with a practical example. 

## Next Steps

Now that you've learned how to define structs in Rust, let's move on to [Method Syntax](/structs-enums/method-syntax/) to understand how to implement methods for our structs. This is where we'll see how Rust's approach to attaching behavior to data compares to JavaScript's class-based approach.
